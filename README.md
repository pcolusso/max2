Inspired by the [ADSP Podcast #76](https://adspthepodcast.com/2022/05/06/Episode-76.html) & [Felipe's writeup](https://blog.piovezan.ca/programming_challenges/largest2/)

The Podcast details different algorithms that could be used to solve the problem of extracting the top 2 elements from a collection. The podcast & writeup focuses on C++, but wanted to explore what options are available in Rust.

I've added benchmarks, which sadly can only explore execution time, to evaluate the performance implications of the code.
